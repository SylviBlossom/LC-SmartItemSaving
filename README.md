# SmartItemSaving
Improves how items save, attempting to prevent updating/removing/adding mods from replacing other modded items on the ship.

**This requires you to both save and load using this mod!** If you plan to install this mod to do modpack changes, first do a launch and save with this mod installed *before* any modpack changes.

This has not been extensively tested with other mods that modify saves, if you encouner any problems please report the bug either on discord or [open an issue](https://github.com/SylviBlossom/LC-SmartItemSaving/issues/new).

## Current features
- Prevent corruption of items in ship when items are added/removed by mods
- Prevent corruption of ship unlockables/furniture too
- Create backup when save is loaded (only one)

## Planned features
- Prevent items falling through the floor on load
- Save item rotation
- Resolve name conflicts for ship unlockables
- *Maybe* Increase item save limit to 999 (configurable)
