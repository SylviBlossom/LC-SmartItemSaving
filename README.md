# SmartItemSaving
Improves how items save, attempting to prevent updating/removing/adding mods from replacing other modded items on the ship, and making items correctly save their positions and rotations.

**This requires you to both save and load using this mod!** If you plan to install this mod to do modpack changes, first do a launch and save with this mod installed *before* any modpack changes.

For fixing items falling through the floor and item rotation saving, all clients must have the mod for them to appear the same when joining.

If you encounter any problems please report the bug either to **sylviblossom** on the Lethal Company Modding discord or [open an issue](https://github.com/SylviBlossom/LC-SmartItemSaving/issues/new).

See also [SaveItemRotations](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/SylviBlossom/PredictableEggs/) for just the item rotation saving feature of this mod.

### Current features
- Prevent corruption of items in ship when items are added/removed by mods
- Prevent corruption of ship unlockables/furniture too
- Prevent items falling through the floor on load
- Save item rotation
- Create backup when save is loaded (only one)

### Planned features
- Resolve name conflicts for ship unlockables
- *Maybe* Increase item save limit to 999 (configurable)
