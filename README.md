# SmartItemSaving
Improves how items save, attempting to prevent updating/removing/adding mods from replacing other modded items on the ship.

**This requires you to both save and load using this mod!** If you plan to install this mod to do modpack changes, first do a launch and save with this mod installed before any modpack changes.
